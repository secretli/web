      <Section title="The key never leaves your browser">
        <p>
          When you create a link, your browser draws a random 256-bit secret. From it, HKDF-SHA512
          derives everything else: the key that encrypts your text or files, the key for the
          metadata, the public ID the server files everything under, and the tokens that prove you
          may read or delete it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secret itself goes only into the part of the link after <Code>#</Code>. Browsers never
          send that part to any server, not to this one and not to the one unfurling a link preview
          in your chat app.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What the server stores">
        <p>
          Ciphertext, encrypted in your browser with XChaCha20-Poly1305. The file names and sizes
          come first, then the files, all in one stream sealed in chunks of 64 KiB that are bound to
          their position, so nothing can be reordered, dropped or cut off. Zeros pad the stream to
          at least 4 KiB, and beyond that by a few percent, so its size says little about what is
          inside. Next to it: the total size, the expiry, whether the link opens once, and hashes of
          the tokens.
        </p>
        <p>
          A reusable secret also gets a mark of whether someone other than you has opened it, but
          not when. Only a link to the secret can read it; that is how the owner link can tell you.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a one-time secret is opened, when a secret is deleted and when it expires, its link
          gets the same answer from then on as one that never existed, so not even the owner link
          can tell which of the three happened. Apart from a download still running, nothing is left
          but the public ID, and only until the secret would have expired: it stays taken so that
          nobody can put a secret of their own under the same link.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is all. The server cannot read the content, cannot see the file names, and cannot
          tell a note from a file.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Opens once">
        <p>
          Links open once unless you choose otherwise. The moment the recipient opens one, the
          server marks it used and refuses every request after that. For files, the download window
          stays open for 15 minutes so the transfer can finish; then the data is gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything expires, from 5 minutes to 7 days after you made it. A cleanup runs every
          minute and removes what has run out.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="Passwords">
        <p>
          With a password, the key for the content is derived from the secret and the password
          together, using scrypt, in your browser. The password never leaves it either. The server
          cannot check a password: a wrong one simply fails to unlock, and trying does not use up a
          one-time secret.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="The owner link">
        <p>
          Your owner link is the recipient's link with a deletion token after <Code>!</Code>. It
          opens the secret too, so keep it to yourself. What it adds is the right to delete the
          secret for everyone and, while a reusable secret lasts, word of whether someone has opened
          it. Once a secret is gone, the owner link says only that, like any other link to it.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="QR codes and codes">
        <p>
          The QR code is the link as an image; the other device reads it with its camera, in its own
          browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          The short code, a number and two words, hands a link to another device without typing it.
          The two browsers run a password-authenticated key exchange (CPace on ristretto255) with
          the two words as the password, prove to each other that they typed the same ones, and only
          then pass the link through the server, encrypted. The server sees neither the words nor
          the link. A code is good for 10 minutes, and a wrong one gives nothing away.
        </p>
      </Section>

      <Section title="What you can check yourself">
        <p>
          The <External href={SOURCE}>source code</External> is public, including the page you are
          reading. The encrypted format is written down in{" "}
          <External href={FORMAT}>one document</External>, and this app and the command-line client
          implement it independently, each checked against the other's output. The images are built
          in the open, carry an SBOM and SLSA provenance, and are signed with cosign. The footer
          names the exact builds you are using, this app's and the server's, each linked to its
          commit. This page allows no scripts, styles or fonts from anywhere but this site, and
          sends no referrer when you follow a link out.
